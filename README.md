# DIDANet: An Attentive Neural Decision Framework
### [website](didanet.wistu.cn) 'didanet.wistu.cn'

#### We present a multimodal deep imaging decision attention network (DIDANet) that integrates radiomics with traditional ML modules and introduces them into a neural network. DIDANet effectively predicts ER and postoperative TACE benefits in HCC patients. Additionally, it addresses overfitting in small-sample medical models to some extent.
